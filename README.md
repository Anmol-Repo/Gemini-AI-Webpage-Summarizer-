Summarizer is a compact, practical Chrome extension that extracts article text from the current tab, sends it to an AI backend to produce concise summaries, and stores a short history of recent summaries (page title + date/time + text). It includes a dark/light mode toggle, rounded modern UI, and export/copy conveniences ‚Äî built to be resume-ready and deployable as a web demo.

---

## Key features

* Summarize any webpage into two modes (customizable): **Quick View** / **Detailed** .
* Save the last 10 summaries to a local history (stores `title`, `date/time`, `summary`).
* Dark / Light mode with persistent preference and an icon that toggles (üåô / ‚òÄÔ∏è).
* Copy summary to clipboard; download as `.txt` .
* Minimal, responsive UI with modern rounded buttons and subtle animations.
* Manifest V3 compatible (background service worker, content script message passing).
---

## Tech stack

* Frontend: HTML, CSS (vanilla), JavaScript (ES6+)
* Chrome APIs: `chrome.storage`, `chrome.tabs`, content scripts, service worker (background)
* Backend: Gemini AI API

## Install & run 

###  Quick local install (unpacked)

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
```

2. Open Chrome ‚Üí `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right)
4. Click **Load unpacked** ‚Üí select the cloned repo folder
5. Click the extension icon to open the popup.

---

## How it works ‚Äî architecture overview

1. **Popup** requests summarization ‚Üí sends a message to the active tab content script: `{ type: "GET_ARTICLE_TEXT" }`.
2. **Content script** extracts readable article text (tries `<article>`, falls back to `p` tags ‚Äî consider Readability.js for better extraction).
3. Extracted text returns to popup. Popup calls `getGeminiSummary(text, mode, apiKey)` to generate summary.
4. Popup saves a history entry to `chrome.storage.local`:

```json
{
  "title": "<tab.title>",
  "date": "2025-08-12 10:23:00",
  "type": "Pulse",
  "summary": "‚Ä¶"
}
```

5. Dark mode state saved in `chrome.storage.local` and applied on popup load.

---

## Permissions (manifest.json)

The extension requests the minimum required:

```json
"permissions": ["scripting","activeTab","storage"],
"host_permissions": ["<all_urls>"]
```

`activeTab` and `scripting` are used to inject/communicate with the content script; `storage` persists API key and history.

---

## Security & privacy

* **No user data leaves your control** except when you explicitly send page text to the configured AI API.
* **API key is stored locally** in `chrome.storage.sync` ‚Äî do not commit it to source control.

---


* Built a Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) that extracts article text and generates AI summaries using remote LLMs.
* Implemented persistent local history (title + timestamp + summary), dark/light mode, and accessible UI with modern styling.
* Used Chrome Storage API, content scripts, message passing, and a Manifest V3 service worker.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Suggested starter tasks:

* Integrate Readability.js for content extraction.
* Add ‚Äúclear history‚Äù and ‚Äúexport history‚Äù functions.
* Improve UI accessibility and keyboard navigation.
